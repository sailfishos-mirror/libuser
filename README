This package is still under development, heavier than I'd expected (though
not so bad that it's unusable).  Only the files and shadow modules are
expected to work at this point, but the rest may work.

This source tree is available via anonymous CVS:
root ":pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/rhl"
password "anoncvs", module "libuser"
