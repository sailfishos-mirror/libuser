This package is still under development, heavier than
intended.  Only the files and shadow modules are expected
to work at this point, as the changes being made to the
module interface ripple out.

The source tree is also available via anonymous CVS:
root ":pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/rhl"
password "anoncvs"
module "libuser"
