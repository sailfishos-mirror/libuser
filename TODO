Medium:
* Implement account locking in LDAP.
* Rework LDAP module lu_ent to LDAPMod mapping to just include additions and
  deletions instead of wholesale modifies, which may run afoul of server
  access controls.
* Add the -o option to luseradd/lusermod/lgroupadd/lgroupmod (bad idea?)
* Create variants of the apps that are hard-coded to use files only, for
  use in batch environments like post-package-install.
* Write an NIS back-end using yppasswd.x in glibc, or maybe using the routines
  declared in /usr/include/rpcsvc/libnis.h

Hard:
* Write a RADIUS back-end.
* Implement an lgpasswd command for local group administration (probably
  would have to be setuid, ugh).
