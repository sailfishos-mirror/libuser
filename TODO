Easy:
* Add non-administrator startup support to the LDAP and Kerberos modules.
  The LDAP module should try to bind to the user or group's object using
  context->auth_name, and Kerberos should connect to the password-changing
  service instead.

Medium:
* Implement account locking in LDAP.
* Rework LDAP module lu_ent to LDAPMod mapping to just include additions and
  deletions instead of wholesale modifies, which may run afoul of server
  access controls.
* Add the -o option to luseradd/lusermod/lgroupadd/lgroupmod.
* Create variants of the apps that are hard-coded to use files only, for
  use in batch environments like post-package-install.
* Write an NIS back-end using yp_update functionality in glibc, maybe
  using the routines declared in /usr/include/rpcsvc/libnis.h
* Write man pages.

Hard:
* Write a RADIUS back-end.
* Add the -m (move home directory) flag to usermod.
* Add the -r option to luserdel.
* Add creation and population of home directories to lusermod.
* Implement an lgpasswd command for local group administration (probably
  would have to be setuid, ugh).
