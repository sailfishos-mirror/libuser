Easy:
* Get SASL binds working with LDAP.

Medium:
* Implement account locking in LDAP and Kerberos 5.
* Add the -o option to luseradd/lusermod/lgroupadd/lgroupmod.
* Write an NIS back-end to interface with yppasswdd.

Hard:
* Add the -m (move home directory) flag to usermod.
* Add the -r option to luserdel.
* Add creation and population of home directories to lusermod.
* Implement an lgpasswd command for local group administration (probably
  would have to be setuid, ugh).
