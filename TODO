Medium:
* Finish the mostly-there LDAP module.
* Add the -o option to luseradd/lusermod/lgroupadd/lgroupmod (bad idea?)
* Create variants of the apps that are hard-coded to use files only, for
  use in batch environments like post-package-install.

Hard:
* Write a RADIUS back-end.
* Write an NIS back-end using yppasswd.x in glibc, or maybe using the routines
  declared in /usr/include/rpcsvc/libnis.h
* Implement an lgpasswd command for local group administration.
